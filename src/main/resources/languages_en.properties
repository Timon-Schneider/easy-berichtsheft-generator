apprenticeship.year=<-- Apprenticeship year:
apprenticeship.year.information=Apprenticeship Year Information
apprenticeshipYearHelpButton=The `Apprenticeship year` is a value that you need to input at the beginning of the document generation process. \n This value should correspond to the year of your apprenticeship that you were in on the 'from date'.\n\nFor example, if the 'from date' is within your first year of apprenticeship, you would input '1'. \nIf the 'from date' is within your second year of apprenticeship, you would input '2', and so on.\n\nAs the document is generated, the program will automatically increment the `apprenticeshipYear` value each time it detects that the current month is your hiring month. \nThis means that if the document spans multiple years and crosses your hiring month, the `apprenticeshipYear` will increase accordingly.\n\nFor instance, if you were hired in March and the document covers a period from January to December, \nthe `apprenticeshipYear` will increment from '1' to '2' when the program reaches March during the document generation.\n\nThis automatic incrementing allows the document to accurately reflect the progression of your apprenticeship over time.

chooseFileButton=The PDF file should be formatted as follows:\n\nIt is important that these placeholders are always inserted anywhere as required: \n\n
chooseFileButton1=(you can enter as many "moTask" or "tuTask" etc. as you wish. It is important to increase the number after the new entry for each additional entry, e.g. "moTask1, moTask2, moTask3, etc" and the maximum number of entries per day must then be adjusted accordingly in GUI)\n
csv.files=CSV files
dailyTasksHelpButton=minDailyTasks and maxDailyTasks are variables that determine the range of tasks the program will generate in a day.\n\nminDailyTasks is the minimum number of tasks the program will generate in a day. For example, if minDailyTasks is set to 3, the program will always generate at least 3 tasks each day.\n\nmaxDailyTasks is the maximum number of tasks the program will generate in a day. For example, if maxDailyTasks is set to 5, the program will never generate more than 5 tasks in a day.\n\nThe actual number of tasks generated each day is randomly chosen between these two values. For example, if minDailyTasks is 3 and maxDailyTasks is 5, the program could generate 3, 4, or 5 tasks in a day.

Navigate to the location of the downloaded ICS file, select it, \nand the program will read the file, extract the event dates and summaries, and add them to your schedule. \n\nPlease note that the ICS file should be properly formatted according to the iCalendar specification. \nIf there is a mismatch between the number of dates and summaries in the file, an error message will shown.

hiring.month=Hiring month:
hiring.month.information=Hiring Month Information
hiringMonthHelpButton=The `Hiring Month` is a value that represents the month in which you started your apprenticeship. \nThis value is important as it is used by the program to track the progression of your apprenticeship over time.\n\nFor example, if you started your apprenticeship in March, the `Hiring Month` would be '3', representing the third month of the year.\n\nAs the document is generated, the program uses this `Hiring Month` value to determine when to increment the `Apprenticeship Year` value. \nEach time the program detects that the current month matches the `Hiring Month`, it understands that a full year of your apprenticeship has passed \nand it increments the `Apprenticeship Year` accordingly.\n\nThis allows the document to accurately reflect the progression of your apprenticeship over time.
